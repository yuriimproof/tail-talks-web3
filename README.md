forge test

# Run tests with verbose output
forge test -vvv

# Run specific test files
forge test --match-path test/unit/StarOwnerTest.t.sol
forge test --match-path test/unit/StarKeeperFactoryTest.t.sol

# Generate gas report
forge test --gas-report

# Generate coverage report
forge coverage
```

## 📦 Deployment

The project includes a comprehensive Makefile with deployment targets for different networks.

### Prerequisites for Deployment

Ensure your `.env` file is configured with the necessary variables:

```bash
# Private key for deployment
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here

# BSC Network URLs
BSC_TEST_RPC_URL=https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545
BSC_MAINNET_RPC_URL=https://bsc-dataseed1.binance.org

# BSC API Key for contract verification
BSC_API_KEY=your-bscscan-api-key
```

### Local Development (Anvil)

```bash
# Start local Anvil node (in separate terminal)
anvil

# Deploy StarOwner to local network
make deploy-star-owner

# Deploy StarKeeperFactory to local network
make deploy-star-keeper-factory
```

### BSC Testnet Deployment

```bash
# Deploy StarOwner to BSC testnet (with verification)
make deploy-star-owner-bsc-testnet

# Deploy StarKeeperFactory to BSC testnet (with verification)
make deploy-star-keeper-factory-bsc-testnet
```

### BSC Mainnet Deployment

```bash
# Deploy StarOwner to BSC mainnet (with verification)
make deploy-star-owner-bsc-mainnet

# Deploy StarKeeperFactory to BSC mainnet (with verification)
make deploy-star-keeper-factory-bsc-mainnet
```

### Available Deployment Commands

View all available deployment targets:

```bash
make help
```

This will show:
```
Available targets:
  deploy-star-owner                       - Deploy StarOwner to local anvil
  deploy-star-keeper-factory              - Deploy StarKeeperFactory to local anvil
  deploy-star-owner-bsc-testnet           - Deploy StarOwner to BSC testnet
  deploy-star-keeper-factory-bsc-testnet  - Deploy StarKeeperFactory to BSC testnet
  deploy-star-owner-bsc-mainnet           - Deploy StarOwner to BSC mainnet
  deploy-star-keeper-factory-bsc-mainnet  - Deploy StarKeeperFactory to BSC mainnet
```

### Deployment Features

- **Automatic Verification**: Testnet and mainnet deployments include contract verification on BSCScan
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses `.env` file for secure credential management
- **Network-Specific**: Separate commands for local development, testnet, and mainnet
- **Verbose Logging**: Detailed deployment logs with `-vvvv` flag for debugging

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Minting Pet NFTs (StarOwner)

```solidity
// Mint with ETH
string memory ipfsUri = "ipfs://QmYourPetPhotoHash";
uint256 tokenId = starOwner.mint{value: mintPrice}(ipfsUri);

// Mint with ERC20 tokens (if enabled)
uint256 tokenId = starOwner.mintWithToken(ipfsUri);
```

### Creating Collections (StarKeeperFactory)

```solidity
// Admins create proposals for new collections
uint256 proposalId = factory.createCollectionProposal(
    "Rescue Dogs of NYC",     // name
    "RESCUE",                 // symbol
    1000,                     // maxSupply
    0.01 ether,              // mintPrice
    100 * 10**18,            // tokenMintPrice
    address(paymentToken),    // paymentToken
    "ipfs://base-uri/",       // baseTokenURI
    "ipfs://collection-image" // collectionImageURI
);

// Other admins vote on the proposal
factory.voteForProposal(proposalId);
```

### Governance Operations

```solidity
// Add new admin (requires 75% approval)
uint256 proposalId = starOwner.createAddAdminProposal(newAdminAddress);
starOwner.voteForProposal(proposalId);

// Update mint prices
uint256 proposalId = starOwner.createSetMintPriceProposal(0.002 ether);
starOwner.voteForProposal(proposalId);

// Withdraw funds
uint256 proposalId = starOwner.createWithdrawFundsProposal(treasuryAddress, amount);
starOwner.voteForProposal(proposalId);
```
